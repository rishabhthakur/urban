# Fabraco

The Fabraco Laravel package is a composer based extension for the Laravel web application framework. It integrates the core web shop component library into any Laravel 5+ based application and allows you to place the components on any page using Blade templates. Default templates for a quick start are already included.

The Fabraco package also includes adapter classes for basic components used by any Laravel application like logging, configuration or URL generation. Thus, it integrates into any application natively that is based on the Laravel framework and leverages the full power of Laravel.
